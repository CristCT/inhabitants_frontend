This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

## Brief description

This project consists of two parts, the [BackEnd](https://github.com/CristCT/inhabitants_backend) and the FrontEnd of the application called inhabitants, to obtain the correct operation of the application, obtain both.

Inhabitants is a web application that is used for the management and control of the access of external people to a building, where we can register people to know in which part of the building they will circulate, in addition to later removing or editing their registration when leaving the building or when requesting a change.
